## Why upLift

> Education is expensive. Mentorship is expensive. However, both should be easily accessible to everyone who desires knowledge and to grow intellectually.
> At upLift we believe in Denzel Washington's famous quote, 'When you get it, reach back, pull someone else up. Each one, teach one.'
>
> upLift is completely free for all users. Share your knowledge with others by becoming a mentor, or gain knowledge
> from others to help grow in your career or grow your intellectual network.
> The knowledge you can gain and give is limitless.
